This is a great talk by Barry Schwartz about the paradox of choice.  Going from no choice to a few choices in almost anything makes for dramatic improvement in our lives from picking jobs to salad dressing to spouses.  However people have falsely assumed that going from a few choices to hundreds of refined choices will make us happier.  In reality, it causes us stress from always wondering if we made the best choice. The happiness/life improvement curve doesn't just flatten out as we get infinitely more choices it actually goes down because of time and energy wasted on making choices.<br />This applies to Village because our game can potentially offer thousands of businesses choices from across the planet to start within the game.  So we'll have to create algorithms just to give meaningful choices to the players because sifting thru thousands of choices will turn the game into a chore.  And we can't just use relevance ranking algorithms like Google ranks webpages.  The choice of businesses have to be relevant and very distinct.  IF choice 1 is Kickstart pumps, means choice 2 can't be IDO pumps that are slightly cheaper but don't last as long, followed by 8 other choices of pumps to solve irrigation issues.  Choice 2 has to be Sun Shines for All (solar panel rentals) which indirectly enables farmers to afford electric irrigation pumps, a meaningfully different solution for the same problem. I wonder who would be doing research on this kind of choice offering.  Hmm...<br /><br /><embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=6127548813950043200&hl=en" flashvars=""> </embed>
