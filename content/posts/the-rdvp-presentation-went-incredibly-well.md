Darian did a presentation to the <a href="http://www.rdvp.org/">Reuters Digital Vision Program</a> on Thursday at Stanford and it went incredibly well.  A few leads and lessons learned:<br /><ul><li>Conveying the Village vision is ten times more effective as a PowerPoint presentation at an organized meeting rather than as a casual conversation at a noisy bar. </li><li>The search for the right Stanford people to advise Village is much farther along now.</li><li>The game is going to be much more useful to existing social entrepreneurs thanks to the input that the RDVP fellows are feeding into the design.<br /></li><li>We might have to change the name of the game to "Pimp my Village". They liked that name a lot. </li></ul>Check out the presentation here uploaded to <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/darian.hickman/VillageTheGameRDVP/photo?authkey=Sr5gcrC8NdY#s5032671983538867554">Picasa Web as a slideshow</a>.<br /><div style="text-align:center;width:194px;font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:83%"><div style="height:194px;background:url(http://picasaweb.google.com/f/img/transparent_album_background.gif) no-repeat left"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/darian.hickman/VillageTheGameRDVP?authkey=Sr5gcrC8NdY"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/darian.hickman/RdekfDnlDVE/AAAAAAAAAxQ/PJtlspwp19Y/s160-c/VillageTheGameRDVP.jpg" width="160" height="160" style="border:none;padding:0px;margin-top:16px;"></a></div><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/darian.hickman/VillageTheGameRDVP?authkey=Sr5gcrC8NdY"><div style="color:#4D4D4D;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;">Village the Game-RDVP</div></a><div style="color:#808080"></div></div>
