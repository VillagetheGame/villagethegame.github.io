Village needs a logo.  My favorite color theme and geometry is definitely BP's logo.  Only it's very flat.  Most of the other logos I like have a little depth with shading or drop shadow like Google.  One ideas I was playing with was the letter V printed on an 18 point star sticker, which was stuck on a round flat stone.  Imagine that. =)  Kinda like a Village coin.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bp.com/home.do?categoryId=1&contentId=2006973"><img id="bpLogo" src="http://www.bp.com/images/bp-logo.gif" alt="BP-Logo" /></a><!-- Begin:Addition for CR 487-->                              <a href="http://www.bp.com/home.do?categoryId=1#belownav"><img src="http://www.bp.com/images/spacer.gif" alt="Skip Navigation - jump to content" border="0" height="1" width="1" /></a><br /><img src="http://www.google.com/intl/en/images/logo.gif" alt="Google" height="110" width="276" /><br /><a href="http://ge.ecomagination.com">http://ge.ecomagination.com</a>.

This whole site is great aesthetic inspiration for Village.<br /><a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/EA%20LOGOrithm.jpg" target="_top"><img style="width: 138px; height: 133px;" src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:9z7JztwXFnT3kM:http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/EA%2520LOGOrithm.jpg" /></a><br />Here's two logos I found while looking for galleries of logos that really caught my eye.<br /><a href="http://www.milestonedesign.co.uk/imgs/logo/halcyon.gif">http://www.milestonedesign.co.uk/imgs/logo/halcyon.gif</a><br /><a href="http://www.milestonedesign.co.uk/imgs/logo/surepharm.gif">http://www.milestonedesign.co.uk/imgs/logo/surepharm.gif</a><br /><br />    <!-- End:Addition for CR 487-->
