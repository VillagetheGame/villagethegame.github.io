Development has come along way, artwork has gone through several iterations of improvement, pathfinding code for our nonplayer characters is going through another revision.  The first set of tiles for the map are 90% done.<br /><br />Even with the progress on the demo though, the biggest advances lately have been connecting with social entrepreneurs at Stanford's <a href="http://www.rdvp.org/">Digital Vision Program</a>.  Entrepreneurs from all over the world have come to Stanford to scale their projects to the next level.  Browse <a href="http://www.RDVP.org">www.RDVP.org</a> and you'll see several serious games in the works to promote social benefits. Things are looking promising for collaboration with Village.  Thank you <a href="http://www.kiwanja.net/">Ken Banks</a> for roping me into this community.<br /><br />Also I recently presented Village to the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/acm/events.html">Stanford ACM</a> and it was very well received.  The audience asked a lot of great questions and we got some solid interest from the CS students on the project now.  <span class="info"><a href="http://acm.stanford.edu/presentations/1_26_07/village_game_stanford_acm_1_26_07.html">View Darian's presentation</a></span> or download the <span class="info"><a href="http://acm.stanford.edu/presentations/1_26_07/village_game_stanford_acm_1_26_07.ppt">PowerPoint here</a></span>.<br /><br />The big paradigm shift I had of late was the kind of game we're making.  Village can start off well as a single-player casual download.  Bryan Wiegele of BigTimeGames.com and Angel Inokon of Playfirst.com helped me realize there's a place for this game in the casual download market which is HUGE because that means we don't have to wait for multiplayer network infrastructure before getting to market. Bryan is refactoring all the docs and spreadsheets I've written up for the demo and is expanding them to a comprehensive design doc for the casual download release of Village.
