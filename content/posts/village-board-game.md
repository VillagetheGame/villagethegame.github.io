As part of "finding the fun" in social enterprise, several <span id="st" name="st" class="st">game</span> designers recommended creating a <span id="st" name="st" class="st">board</span> <span id="st" name="st" class="st">game</span> first. I could use some help doing this. The basic idea I have is create a <span id="st" name="st" class="st">game</span> with similar rules as Cashflow with an added goal of social return on investment in addition to the monetary return on investment. It will be a bit tricky but definitely a fun challenge. Let me know if you're interested in helping out.
