This is outright ingenious!  Researchers at CMU have figured out how to turn tasks still difficult for computers into games for humans.  They are creating a new concept called human computation, and they're getting it done by creating simple games playable over the internet that pretty similar to games like Catchphrase or Taboo. I wonder if this has any application to identifying solutions to extreme poverty?<br /><br /> <embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=-8246463980976635143&hl=en" flashvars="&subtitle=on"> </embed>
