Hey Village, sorry there hasn't been much communication about Village the Game lately.  Darian  (that's me) has started working for a new company in Pasadena that offers educational games for kids in the virtual world <a href="http://www.whyville.net">www.Whyville.net</a>  while I haven't been able to devote anywhere near as much time to Village as I could before the new job, I'm learning so much from working with the people at <a href="http://www.numedeon.com">Numedeon </a>Inc that there's no doubt this opportunity is a huge step forward long term for Village even with the short term loss in time to commit to Village.
