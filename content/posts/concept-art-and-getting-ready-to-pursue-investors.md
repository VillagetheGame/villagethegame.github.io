I want your help getting the concept art done, art I intend to use in the game and on the website for the game and in the proposals to recruit investors. In it's final form Village is a massively multiplayer online strategy game for the PC that immerses the player into the role of an entrepreneur building companies to bring prosperity to the villages of the third world.<br /><br />I need your help creating artwork to depict third world villages/villagers and the technologies the entrepreneurs will be selling: everything from irrigation pumps, to solar cells. All the technology and innovations I'm including in the game actually exist, such as this pump from Kickstart.<br /><br /><ul style="margin-left: 0px; padding-left: 3px; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside; font-size: smaller;"><li> <font>no --  it's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests<br /></span></li><font><li> Compensation: budget: $3000k <br /></li></span></ul><font>   <table summary="craigslist hosted images"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><br /></td>   <td align="center"><br /></td></tr></tbody></table> </span>
