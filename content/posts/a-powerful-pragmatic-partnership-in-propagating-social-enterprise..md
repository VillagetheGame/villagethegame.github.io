<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.villagethegame.com/uploaded_images/HPIM0649-731174.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.villagethegame.com/uploaded_images/HPIM0649-731170.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>After a few months of planning and paperwork, we now have Panango, an NGO ready to send students to Papua New Guinea. There Stanford University students will be exploring the needs of villagers while teaching English.  Village the Game is working with Panango to model these villages inside the game and explore some of the existing solutions in other countries that could also work in Papua New Guinea.<br /><br />Pictured here is founding team of Panango from left to right: Darian Hickman, <span id="st" name="st" class="st">Christa</span> Morris, Nick Benavides, Ally Stewart, Cole Paulson, Chenxing Han, and AdamTolnay.

Through a combination of mentorship, hands on experience, and entrepreneurial simulations such as Village the Game, Panango creates a positive feedback loop where students are trained to find community needs and respond with their own innovative social ventures.  In addition to teaching English and empowering villagers, Panango volunteers develop a forward thinking, activist approach to service: finding needs while meeting needs. </span></span>
