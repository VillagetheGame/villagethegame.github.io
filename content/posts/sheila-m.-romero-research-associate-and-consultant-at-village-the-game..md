She has been an active advocate of human rights and social justice since 1996. She recently relocated to California after working for Minnesota-based non-profit, the Amherst H. Wilder Foundation, where she co-authored a variety of reports based on Wilderâ€™s community research and evaluation studies. While a student at the University of California, Davis, where Sheila obtained her B.A. in International Relations, she moonlighted as a Research Assistant for Student Affairs Research and Information (SARI) and Peer Counselor for the Educational Opportunity Program. In 2004, she obtained her MSc (M.S.) in Globalisation and Latin American Development from the University of London.
