<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://netsquared.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=195226"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.villagethegame.com/uploaded_images/netsquared.pic-759738.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />On March 13th, Village the Game received a great response from the <a href="http://netsquared.meetup.com/1/">NetSquared NetTuesday</a> meeting in San Francisco.  It's really encouraging to meet so many people who want to help Village succeed. <br /><br />Now I'm off to LA to work with buddies in "the industry" for creating some promo videos for Village the Game.   Most recent epiphany I've had: Sharing the vision of Village is a lot more effective in a visual format rather than as a casual conversation at a bar. :)
