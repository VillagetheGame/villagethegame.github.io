As part of "finding the fun" in social enterprise, several game designers recommended creating a board game first.  I could  use some help doing this.  The basic idea I have is create a game with similar rules as Cashflow with an added goal of social return on investment in addition to the monetary return on investment.  It will be a bit tricky but definitely a fun challenge.  Let me know if you're interested in helping out.
