It roughly shows the impact the player has on improving the village.  As the game evolves so will our metric for Village Points.  I'm working on breaking down all the factors inside a <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCRoTBbGNNnVbixuacfPvXQ">spreadsheet</a>.  I'm hosting the spreadsheet on Google Spreadsheets and if you would like to contribute to it please let me know: founder@villagethegame.com. I can add you to the list of collaborators.
