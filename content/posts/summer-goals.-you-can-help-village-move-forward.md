There's 3 main things that we need to get done this summer.  You can help. <br /><br />1. Debug current prototype. Everything is in actionscript 3 so if you have developer friends that can contribute time get them in touch with Darian. <br />2. Add more levels to existing prototype. With the first version, we are going to make each a new solution to poverty.  For example: Level 1: You are selling irrigation pumps, Level 2: You are selling solar lanterns. Level 3: You are selling microloans; and so on. We need developers for this as well. <br />3. Line up partnerships with nonprofits that serve specific villages in Africa. For example:<br />www.buildthevillage.org, www.htn.org, irisministries.org.  If you have contacts at nonprofits like this that are ready to promote their efforts and fundraising via virtual goods, get them in touch with Darian.
