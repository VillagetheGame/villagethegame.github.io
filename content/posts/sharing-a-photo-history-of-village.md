In this album you'll find a lot of the concept art and photos we've used for inspiration during the development of various Village projects, such as the cover art, Village Card Game, and the functional demo.<br /><br />Special thanks to Brandon Lippard who did the photography from Kenya, Darian Hickman who contributed photographs from India, Blake Douglas who worked on the cover and concept art, and Geoff Castro who also worked on the concept art.<br /><br />ENJOY!! :-)<br /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf" width="400" height="267" flashvars="host=picasaweb.google.com&RGB=0x000000&feed=http%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2Fdarian.hickman%2Falbumid%2F5120933802093065489%3Fkind%3Dphoto%26alt%3Drss" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer"></embed>
