Romero, MSc</b></p>  <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">When a human being resorts to living in a dump, it is sheer evidence of poverty hitting rock bottom. In 1999, the United Nations Children’s Fund found an estimated 45,000 children living in dumps around extremely impoverished areas of Brazil. Somalia and Peru’s refuse sites share a common history of families running from civil strife and camping out at dumps; later forging lives for themselves by scavenging for food and items to wear and sell from among the rubbish. Unfortunately, there are no statistics available to pinpoint the number of people currently living in similar situations throughout the world. The fact remains that people living in dumps and landfills expose themselves to hazardous toxins and have no way out of poverty while remaining in their present situations. However, with no one to educate them about these hazards or teach them how to make the most of their available resources, these people most likely will continue to live a vicious cycle of poverty and in the dumps.</p>  <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">There is one organization, however, that has developed an innovative strategy to educate refuse dwellers in urban areas around Peru. Ciudad Saludable (translated as “Healthy City” in English), is a non-profit organization comprised of chemical, industrial, and agricultural engineers who teach people currently living in the dumps how to make a profitable living out of waste management. In addition to helping more than 150 informal trash workers organize into 13 micro enterprises across the country, Ciudad Saludable (CS) has successfully educated and worked with organizations and agencies at the local, regional and national levels to create and implement protective laws for those living and working with trash at the informal sector.  CS has been featured as one of the "New Heroes" on PBS, a program aired on television in 2005.  (See <a href="http://www.pbs.org/opb/thenewheroes/meet/ruiz.html">http://www.pbs.org/opb/thenewheroes/meet/ruiz.html</a> for a brief synopsis on CS's founder, Albina Ruiz.)<span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);font-size:11;" > </span></p>  <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Village the Game has recently partnered up with Cuidad Saludable, and is featuring the organization as one of the infrastructure options for gamers building virtual villages within the game.<br /></p><br />For more information, visit <span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);font-size:11;" ><a href="http://www.ciudadsaludable.org/es/english.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ciudadsaludable.org<wbr>/es/english.htm</a> </span>
