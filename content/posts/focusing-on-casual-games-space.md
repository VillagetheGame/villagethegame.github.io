<p class="MsoNormal">After much conversation, deliberation, and revelation, the design of Village the Game is now drastically simplified to keep it more in line with the expectations of casual game players.<span style="">  </span>Games in this space are usually 20-30 MB in size; contain 12 hours of gameplay, have an easy learning curve, and sell for almost always $19.95.<span style="">  </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Originally I was designing this game by combining everything I liked from Warcraft and SimCity and drafted up a monstrosity of a game concept.<span style="">  </span>Now we have a game design tailored for an audience that is used to games like Diner Dash and Virtual Villagers.<span style="">  </span>Games in this realm are almost entirely single player; they have smaller maps and less content than huge multi-million dollar games like SimCity or Warcraft.<span style="">  </span>(Don’t worry hard-core gamers, once we have successfully launched this casual game we’ll begin work on the multiplayer RTS that was originally envisioned.) <span style=""> </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">The Casual Game space is a great starting point for several reasons: 1) it’s the fastest growing sector at 200% a year.<span style="">  </span>2) Development costs are 10 times less than the Warcraft-and-Sims-type games. 3) The time required to get to market is a third the time of a larger massively-multiplayer project. <span style=""> </span>Those factors combined have made a massively compelling case to postpone massively multiplayer features that require massive budgets, teams, and timelines.<span style="">  </span>Instead we are pursuing something far simpler, and still significant: “Village Casual”.</p>
