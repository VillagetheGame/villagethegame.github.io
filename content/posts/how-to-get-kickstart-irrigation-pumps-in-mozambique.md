I recently corresponded with the Kickstart team in Nairobi, Kenya on how to get their irrigation pumps in Mozambique and here was the response.  Once I get funding for a full fledged site I'll make this a more searchable feature but for now it's a blog post:<br /><br /><blockquote>Let me know how many pumps you need and you can procure them from Total LandCare Mozambique at a cost of 5,600MT per one Super Moneymaker pump, inclusive  with the inlet pipe (5m) and outlet pipe (25m lay flat pipe)and with a set of spare parts.<br /> <br />We did send a container of 40ft (720 pumps) to Total Land Care for their use and resale to other interested organizations. They have currently sold about 270 pumps.  Unless you need a container of pumps it would be more cost effective to get them from Total LandCare in Angonia (in Tete province).<br /> <br />I have copied Dionisio from Total LandCare Mozambique for any assistance you might need.</blockquote>
