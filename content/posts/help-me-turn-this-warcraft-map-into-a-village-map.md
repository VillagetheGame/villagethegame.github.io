I need to translate all the orc buildings and units into Village buildings and units.  The best map editor is the one that comes with Warcraft II.  <a href="http://www.villagethegame.com/downloads/Village1.pud">Download Village1.pud</a> and export it to jpeg somehow.  Then translate the orc units in the jpeg into Village units.  Here's the translation table:<br />Gold mine=Microcredit bank<br />Catapult=kickstart pump<br /><span id="st" name="st" class="st">Barracks</span>=school<br />watch tower by itself=cell tower<br />watch tower by pig farm=solar panel<br />pig farm=farmers hut/house<br />trees next to pig farm=crop<br />dirt path=roads<br />lumber mills = generic store fronts<br />blacksmith = kickstart store front<br />goblin alchemist=Solar Cell Rental Store
